          I am very much looking forward to building my first hand-coded web page in HTML 5. I've noticed I've developed some terrible habits in syntax and structure from my previous attempts many years ago. I especially have to improve the structure of my code, as well as properly commenting my code.
        </p>

          I like the LSD approach Don mentioned earlier. Coding problems either come down to <b>L</b>ogic, <b>S</b>yntax or <b>D</b>ata. Perhaps I need help with all three.
        </p> 
        <p>
          I particularly want to understand the CSS float properties since it always causes significant frustration and I only seem to stubmle on the solutions.

        <h4>My Pet</h4>
        <p>We had a dog named Bagel. His favourite teddy bear was Cream Cheese. He of course was a beagle. He was a good dog and had a good life.</p>

        <h4>My Favourite Colour</h4>
        <p>I like <span class="blue">blue</span>, especially when combined with green. Though not this particular shade but whaddayagonnado. So Vancouver matches that pallette.</p>
